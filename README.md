### ComfyUI-Tensor-Prism-Node-Pack
## Developer Notes

My First ComfyUI Node Pack, vibe coded with Gemini 2.5 Flash and Claude 4. Feel free to publish the models you make and link them to me I'd like to be able to see the models, and see what they're about to see if I need to add more nodes or if the nodes are good and make really good quality checkpoint models. This is also a node pack for those familiar with merging models.

### Recommended Settings by GPU:
- **24GB+ (RTX 4090, etc.)**: Use default settings, batch size 50+
- **12GB (RTX 4070 Ti, etc.)**: Set memory limit to 8GB, enable auto precision, batch size 30-50
- **8GB (RTX 4060 Ti, etc.)**: Set memory limit to 6GB, force CPU for large merges, batch size 10-30
- **6GB and below**: Use CPU processing for best stability, enable aggressive cleanup

## Requirements

- ComfyUI
- PyTorch >= 1.12.0
- NumPy >= 1.21.0
- psutil >= 5.8.0 (for memory management)

## Tips and Best Practices

1. **Start Conservative**: Begin with lower merge ratios (0.3-0.7) and adjust based on results
2. **Use SLERP for Dissimilar Models**: When merging very different models, SLERP often produces better results
3. **Leverage Spectral Methods**: Frequency domain merging can preserve details better than linear methods
4. **Use Masks for Precision**: Create masks to merge only specific model components
5. **Memory Management**: Monitor memory usage and adjust batch sizes for your hardware
6. **Experiment with Spectral Parameters**: Different frequency biases can dramatically change results
7. **Layer-Selective Merging**: Use depth gradients for smooth transitions through model layers
8. **Prediction Type Awareness**: Use the Epsilon/V-Pred nodes when working with models of different prediction types
9. **CLIP Merging Strategy**: Use spectral blend for CLIP when preserving text understanding is critical
10. **Conversion Strength**: Start with 1.0 conversion strength and adjust if results seem over/under-converted
11. **Document Your Workflows**: Use the Checkpoint Reroute + Notes node to keep track of your merging experiments
12. **Organize Complex Workflows**: Use reroute nodes with notes to create clean, documented workflow structures
13. **Layer-Specific CLIP Control**: Use attention/feedforward bias to fine-tune CLIP behavior for specific use cases
14. **Zero Overhead Documentation**: The reroute node adds no processing time while providing workflow organization

## Troubleshooting

- **Memory Issues**: Reduce batch sizes, lower memory limits, or enable CPU fallback
- **Poor Results**: Try different merging methods or adjust spectral parameters
- **Compatibility**: Ensure models are the same architecture (SDXL with SDXL, etc.)
- **Slow Performance**: Check if you're accidentally using CPU when GPU is available
- **Artifacts**: Try more conservative merge ratios or use SLERP for smoother blending
- **Prediction Type Issues**: Use the Epsilon/V-Pred nodes for automatic type conversion
- **CLIP Problems**: Use preserve_norms=True and lower merge ratios for CLIP stability
- **Conversion Artifacts**: Reduce conversion strength or use pure converter instead of block merge
- **Workflow Complexity**: Use Checkpoint Reroute + Notes nodes to organize and document complex merging chains

## Performance Tips

- **Batch Size**: Larger batches are more efficient but use more memory
- **Precision Mode**: FP16 saves memory but may affect quality on some operations
- **Memory Cleanup**: Enable aggressive cleanup for systems with limited RAM
- **Device Selection**: Let the system auto-detect optimal device unless you have specific needs
- **Workflow Organization**: Use reroute nodes to reduce visual complexity without performance impact
- **CLIP Memory**: CLIP merging is less memory-intensive than UNet merging
- **Conversion vs Merging**: Pure conversion uses less memory than block-level merge+convert
